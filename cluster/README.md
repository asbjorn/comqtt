# Comqtt Cluster

The open source Go-implemented mqtt-broker projects on github generally do not support clustering or mqttv5, both of which comqtt supports very well.

Comqtt cluster uses gossip for node discovery and raft for data consistency synchronization. It uses redis to store inflight, retain messages and subscriptions across nodes.

Of course, due to my busy work and lack of more production environment verification, bugs will inevitably occur, so you are welcome to use, raise issues and contribute.

## Cluster Features

- Cluster nodes are automatically discovered using the goosip protocol.
- Subscribe and unsubscribe messages use the raft protocol to synchronize consistency between nodes.
- Publish messages support point-to-point transmission using GRPC, not broadcast to all nodes.
- Both cluser and standalone support bridging messages to kafka, as well as multiple auth&acl ways.
- Horizontal scaling is supported. When adding new nodes, you only need to specify any node in the cluster as the seed node.
- Simple metrics viewing, such as mqtt statistics and cluster statistics.

## Build

```shell
cd cmd
go build -o comqtt cluster/main.go
```

The startup supports two modes: command parameters and configuration file. 

It is recommended that you use the configuration file mode for more detailed configuration.[Click to config example](../cmd/config/node1.yml).

All configuration file examples are in the cmd/config directory. [Click to config examples](../cmd/config)

### Configure Redis

Start redis and configure redis addr, [click to config example](../cmd/config/node1.yml).

### Create Cluster

*Start three nodes on one laptop*

*If you want to obtain the bridge and multiple authentication capabilities, you need to use the configuration file to start.*

#### 1. Start first node
```shell
./comqtt --node-name=c01 --gossip-port=7946 --raft-port=8946 --raft-bootstrap=true
or
./comqtt --conf=./config/node1.yml
```

You should see the output
```
8:16PM INF comqtt server initializing...
8:16PM INF added hook hook=redis-db
8:16PM INF connecting to redis service address=127.0.0.1:6379 db=0 hook=redis-db
8:16PM INF connected to redis service hook=redis-db
8:16PM INF added hook hook=allow-all-auth
8:16PM INF added hook hook=agent-event
8:16PM INF found raft leader leader=c01
8:16PM INF setup raft addr=127.0.0.1:8946 node=c01
8:16PM INF local member addr=127.0.0.1 port=7946
8:16PM INF cluster node created
8:16PM INF attached listener address=:1883 id=tcp protocol=tcp
8:16PM INF attached listener address=:1882 id=ws protocol=ws
8:16PM INF attached listener address=:8080 id=stats protocol=http
8:16PM INF comqtt server started
8:16PM INF notify join addr=127.0.0.1 node=c02
8:16PM INF raft joined addr=127.0.0.1:8947 node=c02
8:17PM INF notify join addr=127.0.0.1 node=c03
8:17PM INF raft joined addr=127.0.0.1:8948 node=c03
```

#### 2. Start second node with first node as part of the member list
```shell
./comqtt --node-name=c02 --gossip-port=7947 --raft-port=8947 --members=localhost:7946 --tcp=:1885 --ws=:1886 --http=:1881
or
./comqtt --conf=./config/node2.yml
```

You should see the output
```
8:16PM INF comqtt server initializing...
8:16PM INF added hook hook=redis-db
8:16PM INF connecting to redis service address=127.0.0.1:6379 db=0 hook=redis-db
8:16PM INF connected to redis service hook=redis-db
8:16PM INF added hook hook=allow-all-auth
8:16PM INF added hook hook=agent-event
8:16PM INF setup raft addr=127.0.0.1:8947 node=c02
8:16PM INF local member addr=127.0.0.1 port=7947
8:16PM INF cluster node created
8:16PM INF attached listener address=:1885 id=tcp protocol=tcp
8:16PM INF attached listener address=:1886 id=ws protocol=ws
8:16PM INF attached listener address=:1881 id=stats protocol=http
8:16PM INF notify join addr=127.0.0.1 node=c01
8:16PM INF raft joining addr=127.0.0.1:8946 node=c01
8:16PM INF comqtt server started
8:17PM INF notify join addr=127.0.0.1 node=c03
8:17PM INF raft joining addr=127.0.0.1:8948 node=c03
```

First node output will log the new connection
```shell
2022/03/17 00:20:44 [DEBUG] memberlist: Stream connection from=192.168.0.103:49756
2022/03/17 00:20:45 [DEBUG] memberlist: Initiating push/pull sync with: 18d26675-d04f-4114-bea2-163e7a68a219 192.168.0.103:7947
```
#### 3. Start third node with first node as part of the member list
```shell
./comqtt --node-name=c03 --gossip-port=7948 --raft-port=8948 --members=localhost:7946 --tcp=:1887 --ws=:1888 --http=:1882
or
./comqtt --conf=./config/node3.yml
```

### Performance (messages/second)

```shell
mqtt-stresser -broker tcp://localhost:1883 -num-clients=500 -num-messages=100
```
Start two nodes on one laptop and test at the same time.

A laptopï¼šMacBook Pro (13-inch, M1, 16G).
